    <p>Teriyaki  is a cooking technique used in Japanese cuisine in which foods are broiled or grilled with
         a glaze of soy sauce, mirin, and sugar.[ </p>
    <p>he word teriyaki derives from the noun teri, which refers to a shine or luster given by the sugar content 
        in the tare, and yaki, which refers to the cooking method of grilling or broiling. Traditionally the meat is
         dipped in or brushed with sauce several times during cooking.</p>
    <p>According to food historians, teriyaki was invented by Japanese chefs in the 1700s.</p>
    <p> The tare is traditionally made by mixing and heating soy sauce, sake (or mirin), and sugar (or honey). 
    The sauce is boiled and reduced to the desired thickness, then used to marinate meat, which is then grilled or broiled. 
    Sometimes ginger is added and the final dish may be garnished with spring onions.</p>
