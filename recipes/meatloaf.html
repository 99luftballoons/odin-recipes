    <h1>Easy Meatloaf</h1>
    <img src="../Images/Meatloaf.jpg" width=200 alt="Picture of a delicious meatloaf with sauce">
    <p>Meatloaf is a dish of ground meat that has been combined with other ingredients and formed into the shape of 
        a loaf, then baked or smoked. The final shape is either hand-formed on a baking tray, or pan-formed by 
        cooking it in a loaf pan.</p> 
    <p>The cooked meatloaf can be sliced like a loaf of bread to make individual portions. It can easily become dry; 
        therefore, various techniques exist to keep the dish moist, like mixing in bread crumbs and egg, covering it with 
        sauce, wrapping it, or using moisture-enhancing ingredients in the mixture, such as filling it with fatty meats, 
        rich cheeses, or vegetables.The cooked meatloaf can be sliced like a loaf of bread to make individual portions.</p>
